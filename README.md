📝 To-Do App (Flask) is a simple, secure, and modern To-Do List Web Application built using Flask, featuring user authentication, task management, SQLAlchemy database integration, and a clean responsive UI. It includes login/logout functionality, password hashing, protected routes using Flask-Login, and user-specific task storage. Users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks that are automatically sorted by creation time. The project uses SQLite by default and can easily be upgraded to MySQL or PostgreSQL. The structure includes blueprints for authentication and tasks, along with well-organized templates and static files. To run the app locally, clone the repository, create and activate a virtual environment, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, initialize the database using db.create_all(), and run the server with flask run. Deployment is simple on platforms like Render using Gunicorn (gunicorn run:app) or via Docker using a lightweight Python image. Requirements include Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Werkzeug, and Gunicorn. The app follows security best practices such as hashed passwords, user-specific task isolation, and environment-based secret keys. Contributions are welcome, the project is MIT licensed, and users are encouraged to star the repository. Created with ❤️ by Aditya Singh.
